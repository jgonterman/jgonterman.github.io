    <h4>Welcome!</h4>
    <p>My name is Jeremy Gonterman, and I am going to teach you the basics of music theory. Many musicians, rather professional or hobbyists, cannot read music. In fact, some of the most famous musicians of all time cannot, such as Prince, Eric Clapton, Elvis Presley, and Michael Jackson. Music theory does not define the quality of the musician, but it does make it easier to communicate with other musicians. If you follow this step-by-step guide, you will learn the foundations of music theory, and be able to confidently read and write music!</p>
