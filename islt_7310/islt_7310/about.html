<h4>
    BM Graduate
</h4>
<p>
    Again, my name is Jeremy Gonterman, and I have spent 18 years involved in music. Throughout that time, I have learned 5 instruments (trumpet, guitar, bass, piano, and drums), played in ensembles that have traveled the country and internationally, and owned my own mixing / mastering business. I graduated from Missouri Western State University in 2019 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Audio Engineering and have taken 9 years’ worth of music theory courses. In 2019 I sold my company and joined Pepsi as a Bulk Customer Representative. These days I am an Independent Account Manager and MBA student at the University of Missouri. I am also seeking a Marketing certificate, with an estimated graduation date of December 2024.

    “Music is the <strong>universal</strong> language of <em>nature</em>; and <em>man</em>, whether in a savage or a civilized state, seeks for gratification from the charms of this divine art; which becomes generally interesting, because it appeals directly to the senses and imagination.” – Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
